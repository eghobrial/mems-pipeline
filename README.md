mems-pipeline
=============

We provide a Pipeline for reconstructing the HCP data. The pipeline consists of four functional modules:

1.	 Data validation: checks if all required data files are present.

2.	 Data reconstruction:  reconstructs the fMRI images.

3.	Quality control: calculates temporal SNR maps.  

4.	Pre-processing: corrects for motion and distortion using FSL TOPUP.
